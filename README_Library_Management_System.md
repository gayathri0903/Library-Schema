# ðŸ“š Library Management System â€” SQL Schema

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project defines the database design for a Library Management System. It allows libraries to track books, members, borrow/return transactions, and manage staff records. It can be used in schools, universities, or public libraries.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench â€” for designing and executing SQL scripts
- ER Diagram tool â€” to visually represent relationships between tables

## ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Included
- `schema.sql` â€” Contains the SQL code to create all necessary tables
- `ERD.png` â€” A diagram showing how the tables are connected
- `README.md` â€” This file

## ðŸ§¾ Tables Overview

- ðŸ“— Books: Information about each book (title, author, ISBN, category, copies available)
- ðŸ‘¤ Members: People who borrow books (name, contact, registration date)
- ðŸ“‹ Borrowings: Records of which member borrowed which book and when
- ðŸ‘¥ Staff: Library employees who manage the system
- ðŸ“¬ Returns: Records of returned books and any fines (if applicable)
- ðŸ—ƒ Categories: Book genres or subjects (e.g., Fiction, Science, History)

## ðŸ”— How Tables Are Connected

- A member can borrow multiple books â†’ Borrowings table
- Each book can belong to a category â†’ Categories table
- Staff members may be linked to check-ins/returns
- Borrowings and Returns are tied together using BookID and MemberID

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Run the script inside `schema.sql` to create the database and tables
3. Refer to `ERD.png` for a visual layout of how tables relate

## ðŸ–¼ ER Diagram
See the file ERD.png in this folder to understand the table relationships

## âœ… Status
This database is ready to be integrated into a web or desktop-based library management system.
